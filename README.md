**Attention!** The repository is **retired** and **archived**. It will not be developed any further and the related images on Docker Hub will not be rebuilt any more. They will phase out and they will be deleted after becoming too old. Please use the newer **third generation** (G3) repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3] and the related images on Docker Hub instead. If you still need images based on `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`, then feel free using the repository for building the images locally.

### Overview

This project's goal is to create a user friendly ambient where anyone could use easily the pipeline. It consists in a Docker Compose structure where all software are in an isolated environment, the containers,ยง in communication with the machine. Periodically (every 5 seconds) the machine will check the workdir if there are the files necessary to start the pipe, and then will proceed automatically to start the pipeline, using a Python script. In the workdir will then be added specific folders named after the softwares, that will contain the output files generated.    

***

### Docker compose structure

This project repository contains resources for building various Docker images based on [Ubuntu][docker-ubuntu] with [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment and [VNC][tigervnc]/[noVNC][novnc] servers for headless use.

The resources for the individual images and their variations are stored in the subfolders of the [Git Hub][this-github] repository and the image features are described in the individual README files. Additional descriptions can be found in the common project [Wiki][this-wiki].

All images are part of a growing [image hierarchy][this-wiki-image-hierarchy].

In the docker-compose.yml file the containers talk in bridge network, and each container has its unique purpose, with its unique image installed, as specified on the pipeline. 

Each container is binded to a user's file system folder where all the executable files are, and where files are processed.

There is one container, named "monitor", that has the GUI where the user can work into, that uses the image "xubuntu-no-vnc-biotech:latest". In this last container the user has root privileges to enable file actions.

### Docker containers and images 

Here's a list of the containers name we used associated to the docker images retrievable on https://hub.docker.com:

-[monitor][this-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc]

-[busco][this-docker-busco]

-[cdhit][this-docker-cdhit]

-[corset][this-docker-corset]

-[fastqc][this-docker-fastqc]

### Working Directory








#### [xubuntu-vnc-novnc][this-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc]

Contains resources for building [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][this-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc] base images.

The images are streamlined and simplified versions of my other images [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].

Several variations are available, including the one supporting overriding both the container user and the user group.

These base images already include commonly used utilities **ping**, **wget**, **zip**, **unzip**, **sudo**, [curl][curl], [git][git] and also the current version of [jq][jq] JSON processor.

Additional components and applications can be easily added by the user because **sudo** is supported.



#### [xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium][this-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium]
  
Contains resources for building [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium][this-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium] images with the open-source [Chromium][chromium] web browser.

#### [xubuntu-vnc-novnc-firefox][this-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-firefox]
  
Contains resources for building [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc-firefox][this-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-firefox] images with the current [Firefox Quantum][firefox] web browser.

Several variations are available, including the one supporting easy pre-configuration and copying of personal Firefox user preferences.

The images are streamlined and simplified versions of my other images [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-plus][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-plus] and [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-default][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-default].

***

### Python Package Utils

#### [/.pipePackage][this-github-utils]
  
Contains utilities that make building the images more convenient.

- `util-hdx.sh`  

  Displays the file head and executes the chosen line, removing the first occurrence of '#' and trimming the line from left first. Providing the line number argument skips the interaction and executes the given line directly.
  
  The comment lines at the top of included Dockerfiles are intended for this utility.
0
  The utility displays the help if started with the `-h` or `--help` argument. It has been developed using my other utilities `utility-argbash-init.sh` and `utility-argbash.sh`, contained in the [accetto/argbash-docker][accetto-github-argbash-docker-utils] Git Hub repository, from which the [accetto/argbash-docker][accetto-docker-argbash-docker] Docker image is built.

- `util-refresh-readme.sh`  
  
  This script can be used for updating the `version sticker` badges in README files. It is intended for local use before publishing the repository.

  The script does not include any help, because it takes only a single argument - the path where to start searching for files (default is `../docker`).

## Issues

If you have found a problem or you just have a question, please check the [Issues][this-issues] and the [Wiki][this-wiki] first. Please do not overlook the closed issues.

If you do not find a solution, you can file a new issue. The better you describe the problem, the bigger the chance it'll be solved soon.

***

## Running the service and Usage
**Watch out!** Before running and using the service you'll need to perform the previous step.

Now, you are ready to run the service and suddenly execute the pipeline. Everytime you will need to execute the pipeline, please type the following command:
```
sudo service pipeline start
```

***

## Uninstallation

**Attention!** To uninstall this full pipeline service, you'll need to be **root** or a **sudoer user**. Consider that, uninstalling this service, will also destroy your cloned repository.

If you have the need to remove this service, or you are having trouble with filesystem conflicts or anything else, please use our one-step uninstall script. Please move inside `/utils/pipeInstall/` and use the following command:
```
python3 pipeUninstall.py
```
The service will be removed from `/etc/init.d`, all files will be deleted and the tree directory structure will be purged. If you would like to reinstall it, you'll have to clone this repository again and repeat the process of installation.
