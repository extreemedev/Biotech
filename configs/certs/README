This is the directory to put a 'self.pem' file containing the
site certificate for for your Docker host. When the container
starts up it will copy the self.pem file from here to /noVNC/
where the noVNC server can use it. 

You  probably want the site cert only readable by root inside
the container so remember to 

    chmod 600 self.pem

Also, you will want to use the -h parameter to tell the docker
container what the hostname is, or browsers 'gonna complain about
hostname mistmatch with the site cert.
